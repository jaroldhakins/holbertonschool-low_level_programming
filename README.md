# General

* In this repository you will see everything that I've learned about C# program language from scratch, I've learned everything based on projects, in most of the repositories, there are only the functions, if you need the main function to execute them, feel free to ask me through my email: stivenhakins@gmail.com.

* If you continue looking at my other repositories, you will see that I made a command interpreter(shell) based on all the knowledge acquired in this language.
